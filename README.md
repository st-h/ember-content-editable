Ember cli contenteditable component, with placeholder and value binding. Use it just like an `input` or `textarea`, but it will autoresize for you.

## Compatibility

* Ember.js v4.4 or above
* Ember CLI v4.4 or above
* Node.js v14 or above

### Versions

Version 3.0.0 targets ember octane apps only. If you need support for older ember versions, please see previous versions of this addon. Version 3.0.0 is based on the [ember-content-editable-modifier](https://github.com/st-h/ember-content-editable-modifier) addon.

Major changes as of **3.0.0**:
- *Breaking*: it is no longer possible to use two way binding within components, so consuming apps need to handle updates by providing a @onChange function!
- *Breaking*: event handler names are changed to follow a consistent pattern
- internal rewrite

## Demo

Our demo page can be found [here](http://st-h.github.io/ember-content-editable/)

## Installation

`ember install ember-content-editable`

## Usage

Use it just like `input` or `textarea`:

```
<ContentEditable @value={{this.value}} @onChange={{fn (mut this.value)}} @placeholder="Your name"/>
```

### Options

Option Name          | Description                                    | Default
---------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------
value                | The value to be edited                         | `""`
placeholder          | Placeholder displayed when value is blank      | `""`
spellcheck           | Uses browsers spellcheck, same as with `<input>` | none
disabled             | If true, element can't be edited, focused or tabbed to | false
maxlength            | Maximum length of the input, in characters     | none
allowNewlines        | If false, linebreaks can't be entered          | true
autofocus            | If true, the element will be focused once inserted into the document | false
clearPlaceholderOnFocus | If true, the placeholder will be cleared as soon as the element gains focus (even if no content is present yet) | false


### Events

This addon supports events supported by the ember component model (except for keyboard events). See the ember documentation for details or the dummy app within the test folder for an example. As this addon uses keyboard events slightly renamed hooks are available as making use of the default hooks would override the addons implementation.

event | description | argument
-- | -- | --
**onLengthExceeded** | if `maxlength` is set, every action that exceeds the limit triggers this event | total numbers of character entered (number)
**onEnter** | triggers when the enter key is pressed | event
**onEscape** | triggers when the escape key is pressed | event
**onKey** | keydown event propagation | event
**onPaste** | triggers when content is pasted successfully (does not fire when maxlength is exceeded) | pasted text content (string)

### Customizing Placeholder Color

```
.ember-content-editable:empty {
  color: rgba(0,0,0,0.6);
}
```

## Common Problems

These are some solutions to common problems browsers have with contenteditable elements.

### Tab Index

The `tabindex` attribute is bound to the element in the DOM, but only [certain tags support it](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#adef-tabindex).

>The following elements support the tabindex attribute: A, AREA, BUTTON, INPUT, OBJECT, SELECT, and TEXTAREA.

So to use `tabindex`, you'll also need to set `tagName` to one of those.

### Newlines aren't showing

Try using `whitespace: pre-line;` or `whitespace: pre-wrap;` in your CSS.

### I can't blur the element

A solution to this is to call `window.getSelection().removeAllRanges()` after you call `blur()` on the element.

For example, if you have `enter='endEditing'` on your content-editable, the following action would prevent the newline and blur the element.

```
endEditing(contentEditable, event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  contentEditable.element.blur();
  window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
}
```

### Cursor appears too big when element is empty

Setting `display: block;` in CSS seems to solve this.
